# ContextCoin (CTX) Program API Reference

This document provides a detailed API reference for the ContextCoin (CTX) program on the Solana blockchain. It outlines all available instructions, account structures, error codes, and other essential information for developers who wish to interact with the program.

## Program ID

The program's deployed address is: `<YourProgramIdHere>` *(Replace this with your actual program ID)*

## Program-Derived Addresses (PDAs)

This program uses Program-Derived Addresses (PDAs) to securely store program state. The following PDAs are used:

*   **ICO State Account:**
    *   **Seed:** `b"ico_state"` + `owner_public_key`
    *   **Purpose:** Holds the current state of the ICO, including the token mint, supply, and bonding curve information.
*   **Escrow Account:**
    *   **Seed:** `b"escrow_account"` + `owner_public_key`
    *   **Purpose:** Holds SOL raised during the ICO.
*   **Resource Access State Account:**
    *   **Seed:** `b"resource_state"` + `server_public_key`
    *   **Purpose:** Stores information about a particular resource and its access fee.

## Data Serialization

All instruction data and account state is serialized/deserialized using the [Borsh](https://borsh.io/) serialization format.

## Additional Notes

*   All amounts are in lamports (1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports).
*   The program uses the System Program (`11111111111111111111111111111111`) for SOL transfers and the SPL Token program.
*   This API is subject to change; always refer to the latest version of this document.
